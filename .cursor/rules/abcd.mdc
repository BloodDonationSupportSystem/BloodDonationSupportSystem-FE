Coding standards, domain knowledge, and preferences that AI should follow.
- Follow best practices for code organization and structure.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Write comments to explain complex logic.
- Always reference with template(reference-only-do-not-modify) folder.
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task.
- Remember this project use Ant Design.
- Use TypeScript types and interfaces for better type safety.
- Project's theme color should be like any medical application.
- Always use Tailwind CSS and Ant Design for styling.
- Never use raw CSS or inline styles.
- Write unit tests for critical components and logic.
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- Use consistent formatting and indentation.
- Keep dependencies up to date.
- Optimize performance and loading times.
- Remember this project is about Blood Donation Support System.
- Style UI related code using Tailwind CSS.
- Use React for building user interfaces.
- Use Redux for state management.
- Use React Router for navigation.
- Use Axios for API calls.
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting.
- Use Jest for unit testing.    
- Use React Testing Library for testing React components.
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience.
- Use Git for version control.
- Use GitHub for collaboration and code reviews.
- Style UI related to our topic project Blood Donation Support System.
- Use Ant Design for pre-built components and styling.
- Use React Query for data fetching and caching.
- Use React Hook Form for form handling and validation.
- Use React Icons for icons in the UI.
- Use React Helmet for managing document head.
- Use React Toastify for notifications.
- Use React Router DOM for routing in React applications.
- Use React Redux for integrating Redux with React.
- Use React DevTools for debugging React applications.
- Use React Lazy and Suspense for code splitting and lazy loading.
- Use React Context API for managing global state.
- Use React Fragments for grouping elements without adding extra nodes.
- Use React Portals for rendering children into a DOM node outside the parent component.
- Use React Error Boundaries for catching JavaScript errors in components.
- Use React Profiler for measuring performance of React applications.
- Use React Strict Mode for highlighting potential problems in an application.
- Use React.memo for optimizing functional components.
- Use React.useCallback for memoizing callback functions.
- Use React.useMemo for memoizing values.
- Use React.useRef for accessing DOM elements and persisting values across renders.
- Use React.useState for managing local state in functional components.
- Use React.useEffect for side effects in functional components.
- Use React.useLayoutEffect for synchronously running effects after all DOM mutations.
- Ensure the architecture is modular and scalable.
- Use a component-based architecture for building UI.
- Use a service-oriented architecture for API interactions.
- Use Atomic Design principles for UI components.
- Ensure Separation of Concerns (SoC) in the codebase.
- Use a monorepo structure for managing multiple packages.
- Organisms should be composed of smaller components (atoms and molecules).
- Templates should be used for layout and structure.
- Pages should represent the final output of the application.
- Molecules should be composed of atoms and organisms.

- Atoms should be the smallest building blocks of t
